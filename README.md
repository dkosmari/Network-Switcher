# Network Switcher

This is an Aroma plugin to switch between network profiles on the Wii U.


## Usage

- Open the Wii U Plugin System Config Menu (press **L** + **ðŸ¡“** + **SELECT**)

- Enter the **Network Switcher** settings.

- Select the network profile you want to use and press **A**.

Note: this change is not permanent. The Wii U will always try to use the default profile
when it boots up.

You can also change which profile is the default in the plugin.
